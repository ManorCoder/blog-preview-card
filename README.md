# 1. Project Summary
- **Description:** This project is a solution to the Blog Preview Card challenge from Frontend Mentor. The goal is to build a blog preview card component using HTML and CSS, following best practices for responsive design
- **Objective:** Build a blog preview card component using HTML and CSS, applying responsive design.

## 2. Process
**Planning:**

I started by researching the design and structure of the card in Figma.
I first developed the HTML structure semantically, then applied styling, prioritizing work-mobile and later adapting it for responsiveness.
Development:

I implemented the responsive design without using media queries, relying solely on clamp() and relative units like em and vh.

## 3. Technologies Used
- **HTML:** For the semantic structure of the content.
- **CSS:** For the design and implementation of the responsive layout.
  - Used flexbox for element positioning.
  - Utilized clamp() for dynamic responsiveness to screen size changes.
  - Applied relative units like em and vh to improve scalability and responsiveness.


## 4. Challenges Faced
The hardest part for me was implementing responsive design without using media queries as a challenge. The most complicated part that took time was trying to understand clamp and other relative units, so I had to research resources to get a clearer understanding. Now I grasp the general concept, but I believe I will need more practice. This is just the beginning of learning something new. It took me several days to understand, but I am satisfied with the result.

Additionally, I focused on analyzing the design structure and comparing it with the original.
